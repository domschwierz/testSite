		<p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
		I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
		She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
		In the shape of an "L" on her forehead</p>
		<p>Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
		Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
		Didn't make sense not to live for fun
		Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
		So much to do, so much to see
		So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
		You'll never know if you don't go
		You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>
